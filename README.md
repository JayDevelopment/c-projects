# Daily C Projects

Welcome to my repository of daily C projects! This is a living archive where I experiment with new ideas, learn more about C programming, and build small utility programs. New projects are added regularly—sometimes daily—so check back often for fresh content.

## Overview

This repository contains a wide range of C programs, from simple utilities to experimental code snippets. Each project is organized by its source file (or folder) and is designed to solve a specific problem or demonstrate a programming concept.

## Contributing

Although this repository is primarily for my own learning and experimentation, I welcome any suggestions or contributions that might improve the projects. Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## License

This repository is provided for educational and experimental purposes. You are free to use, modify, and share the code.
